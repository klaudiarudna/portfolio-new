            <h2>💼 Embedded Senior Designer (Project Partnership)</h2>
            
            <h3>What it is</h3>
            <p>End-to-end product and service design support for medium-to-large organisations. I embed directly into your team to take ownership of discovery, design, and delivery. This is accountable execution—I don't need managing, I just need a direction.</p>
            
            <h3>The problems I solve</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>Projects are stalling due to unclear requirements or shifting priorities.</li>
              <li>Your current team is stretched and you need someone to hit the ground running.</li>
              <li>Design choices aren't being clearly tied to business outcomes.</li>
              <li>You need senior capability now, without the lead time of a permanent hire.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What you gain</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> I take the brief and run with it, freeing up your Leads to manage.</li>
              <li><strong>Delivery Momentum:</strong> Reduced risk through validated decisions and faster output.</li>
              <li><strong>Cross-Functional Glue:</strong> Strong collaboration across product, engineering, and stakeholders.</li>
              <li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Shippable products and services, not just theory.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ideal for</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>Product teams in scale-ups or enterprise environments.</li>
              <li>Organisations requiring IR35-compliant senior support.</li>
              <li>Critical projects needing a 3–12 month sprint to launch.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="service-meta"><strong>Engagement:</strong> 3–12 months (Full-time or near full-time)</p>

          <div id="fractional-designer" class="service-section">
            <h2>⏱️ Fractional Senior Designer</h2>
            
            <h3>What it is</h3>
            <p>Ongoing product and service design support for startups and SMEs. I provide the continuity and strategic thinking of a founding designer on a flexible basis—bridging the gap between ad-hoc freelancers and a full-time senior hire.</p>
            
            <h3>The problems I solve</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>You are at a stage where a full-time Senior Designer is too expensive, but juniors lack the experience to work alone.</li>
              <li>Freelancers solve isolated tasks but miss the wider business context.</li>
              <li>Strategy resets every time a new contractor joins.</li>
              <li>Founders are making critical product decisions without a design partner.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What you gain</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> Product direction that compounds over time, rather than resetting.</li>
              <li><strong>Institutional Memory:</strong> A partner who deeply understands your business context.</li>
              <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Senior-level execution without the overhead of a full-time salary.</li>
              <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Systems and processes set up correctly for when you do hire full-time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ideal for</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>Founders and small product teams.</li>
              <li>Startups and SMEs in a growth phase.</li>
              <li>Teams needing ongoing senior design input but not a full 40-hour week.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="service-meta"><strong>Engagement:</strong> Ongoing (Typically 1–3 days per week)</p>

            <h2>🗺️ Service Design for Operations (Automation Mapping)</h2>
            
            <h3>What it is</h3>
            <p>I apply service design thinking to your internal operations. We map the reality of your workflow to uncover friction, simplify processes, and identify where automation will actually deliver ROI—before you invest in tools.</p>
            
            <h3>The problems I solve</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>Processes are messy, manual, or trapped in "tribal knowledge."</li>
              <li>Past automation efforts failed because the underlying process was broken.</li>
              <li>You don't know what to automate first to get the best return.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What you gain</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">

              <li><strong>Prioritised Roadmap:</strong> Identified opportunities ranked by impact and effort.</li>
              <li><strong>Vendor Alignment:</strong> A single source of truth that aligns tech vendors around scope, priorities, and outcomes.</li>
              <li><strong>Risk Reduction:</strong> No obligation to proceed with a build until the logic is proven.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ideal for</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>Operations-heavy businesses.</li>
              <li>SMEs preparing to scale headcount or volume.</li>

              <li>You have data, but no insight on how to act on it.</li>
