          <p class="case-tag">CONTEXT & CHALLENGE</p>
          <h2>A Siloed View Blocking Strategic Decisions</h2>
          <p>The business lacked a single source of truth for customer journeys. Processes were siloed, ownership was unclear, and no visual framework connected customer touchpoints to the complex systems behind them.</p>
          <p>The challenge was threefold:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Misaligned expectations: Some stakeholders saw the blueprint as a tool to support a transition to a new pricing model, others wanted improvements to the current model.</li>
            <li>Timing risk: Mapping began late in the project, raising concerns from the project manager that new discoveries could delay delivery.</li>
            <li>Maturity gap: The business was accustomed to detailed customer journeys, but a service blueprint requires a higher-level, systems perspective. Managing expectations was critical.</li>

          <h2>Leading Clarity from Discovery to Decision</h2>
          <p>My goal: build a service blueprint capturing customer and employee experience, systems, and processes — giving leadership a strategic tool to make informed, data-driven decisions.</p>
          <p>I acted as strategist, facilitator, and designer of the blueprinting process, responsible for:</p>

        <h2>Reducing Manual Work by 80% and Unlocking £200k in Value</h2>
        <p>The blueprint delivered both immediate operational value and long-term strategic clarity - proving how structured collaboration and systems thinking can uncover measurable business impact.</p>

            <li><b>70–80% reduction</b> in repetitive manual work for the sales team, freeing <b>1.5–2.5 FTEs</b> and generating an estimated <b>£100k–£200k in annual savings</b>.</li>

        <h2>Defining and mitigating project risks</h2>
        <p>Before mapping began, I analysed project risks and designed a structure to deliver fast, meaningful results within six weeks — aligning 28+ stakeholders while keeping the blueprint usable long after delivery.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Designing for Impact</h3>
          <p>Time was limited, so the focus was on <b>achievability with strategic value.</b></p>
          <p>Rather than capturing every detail, I prioritised an <b>end-to-end view</b> that revealed dependencies, inefficiencies, and automation opportunities leadership could act on immediately. </p>
          <p>Detail was treated as a secondary layer — to be added once value was proven.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Stakeholder Management</h3>
          <p>The project involved the COO and six departments. I created a clear involvement map showing who contributed, reviewed, and approved each stage.</p>
          <p>All workshops were scheduled in advance with two date options to reduce no-shows and maintain momentum.</p>
          <p>Ownership was clarified early so everyone knew who was responsible for input and long-term updates to the blueprint.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <img src="..\img\sbstakeholders.png" alt=""></a>
          <p class="small txt-secondary">I created a dedicated slack channel for stakeholders communication.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Managing Expectations</h3>
          <p>Different teams expected different outcomes — from a detailed process map to a strategic tool.
At kick-off, I reframed the blueprint as a decision-support artefact, not a delivery blocker.</p>
          <p>Success criteria were defined and validated via survey:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Alignment and adoption by leadership</li>
            <li>Clarity of ownership across touchpoints.</li>
            <li>Use of blueprint in decision-making</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Regular playback sessions kept expectations aligned and engagement high.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Scoping for Progress</h3>
          <p>To avoid scope creep, I split the work into two clear milestones:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Current-state blueprint (first hand-off and validation milestone)</li>
            <li>Future-state vision (post-adoption iteration)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>TThis phased delivery made progress visible and ensured focus on what mattered most.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Driving Adoption</h3>
          <p>Longevity was designed in from the start.</p>
          <p>The blueprint lived in Miro, a tool already familiar across teams.</p>
          <p>I introduced colour-coded templates and usage rules for consistency and ease of maintenance.</p>
          <p>Cards allowed for links, ownership, and layered detail — keeping the map clean yet actionable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Facilitation</h3>
          <p>Workshops followed a four-week cadence, mixing group sessions with 1:1s.</p>
          <p>A test workshop validated clarity before scaling, and a progressive build approach prevented groupthink while maintaining momentum.</p>
          <p class="quote">“Even just this call has been useful - hearing from people in areas I wouldn’t normally work with.”<span >– Finance Team</span></p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h2>Reflections & Learnings</h2>
          <p>The project validated that structure, facilitation, and framing are critical when introducing new ways of working in a complex environment.</p>

          <h3>What Worked</h3>

          <p>A structured facilitation approach — moving from individual input to group collaboration — kept conversations focused and inclusive.</p>
          <p>Running a test workshop early on helped refine tools and prompts before scaling to larger groups.</p>
          <p>The progressive blueprint build maintained momentum and allowed insights to surface organically, rather than forcing consensus too early.</p>
          <p>Using Miro templates and rules ensured consistency, which made handover smooth and adoption straightforward.</p>

          <h3>What Was Challenging</h3>

          <p>Early sessions had unexpectedly high attendance, which required on-the-spot adaptation of facilitation methods and timing.</p>
          <p>Some stakeholders initially expected a highly detailed process map, not a strategic artefact, so managing that transition in mindset took deliberate communication and steady reinforcement through playback sessions.</p>

          <h3>What I’d Do Differently</h3>

          <p>Next time, I’d run a pilot workshop earlier to validate assumptions about detail level and participant readiness before the main series.</p>
          <p>I’d also set clearer expectations around fidelity from the outset to reduce rework and help teams focus on insight rather than precision.</p>

          <h3>Why It Matters</h3>

          <p>The project proved that even within tight timelines, it’s possible to turn fragmented processes and perspectives into a shared, actionable artefact that drives strategic decisions.</p>
          <p>It showed how a well-facilitated blueprinting process can do more than visualise systems — it can shift how teams collaborate, prioritise, and deliver value.</p>
