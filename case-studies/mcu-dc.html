          <h2>Bridging a Fragmented Ecosystem</h2>
          <p>Dealers faced a fragmented ecosystem: multiple customer types (single- and multi-location, manual and feed), legacy users (eBay, Gumtree, Motors.co.uk), and diverse vehicle types. Multiple internal and external systems - Dealer Centre Stock and Response, MCU backends, eBay and Gumtree tools - lacked a single source of truth.</p>
          <p>The goal was to <b>create a single platform</b> that unified stock management, lead response, and account oversight across all systems, while handling multi-location relationships and complex data flows.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Users Across Multiple Platforms</h2>
        <p>I combined qualitative and quantitative research to understand dealer workflows and pain points across eBay, Gumtree, Motors.co.uk, and internal systems. Methods included:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Analytics review from internal databases and Google Analytics to map usage patterns.</li>
            <li>Heatmaps and Hotjar recordings to identify friction in stock and response flows.</li>
            <li>Dealer surveys to capture perceptions of Dealer Centre functionality.</li>
            <li>Interviews with account managers to understand support queries and operational pain points.</li>
            <li>GAP analysis comparing legacy eMP (eBay/Gumtree) systems with Dealer Centre workflows.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="subsection">
          <h2>Simplifying Multi-System Workflows</h2>
          <p>Focused on reducing friction in adding, editing, and managing stock across different backends (ColdFusion for Stock, .NET C# for Response). Activities included:</p> 
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Over 15 moderated user tests with dealers on prototypes (Figma) and legacy tools.</li>
            <li>Redesigning vehicle description fields and taxonomy to accommodate multiple vehicle types and platform requirements.</li>
            <li>Designing a scalable architecture for stock management that supports feed and manual dealers, single- and multi-location accounts.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="subsection">
          <h2>Unifying UX Across Merged Systems</h2>
          <p>Created a single interface bridging Stock and Response, while respecting technical and operational constraints:</p> 
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Developed a <b>Figma Design System</b> to unify UI elements across React (Response FE) and ColdFusion (Stock FE).</li>
            <li>Improved information architecture and navigation to <b>reduce cognitive load</b> in multi-system journeys.</li>
            <li>Conducted moderated and unmoderated tests (usertesting.com, Axure, SUPR-Q) to validate usability and performance.</li>
            <li>Ensured the unified platform supported multi-level relationships: <b>Accounts / Groups / Dealers</b>, including Salesforce-driven account creation.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="subsection">
          <h2>Stabilising Technical Systems</h2>
          <p>Worked closely with internal technical teams to improve reliability and reduce operational risk.</p> 
          <p>Produced a 14-page report detailing dealer setup issues, feeding into BAU improvements and risk mitigation.</p>

          <div class="subsection">
          <h2>Navigating Constraints and Complexities</h2>
          <p>Despite a clear vision for a unified platform, the project faced significant challenges and delays.</p> 
          <p>Integrating multiple legacy systems - each with its own technical constraints, inconsistent data structures, and operational quirks meant progress was slower than hoped. Some workflows had to be redesigned multiple times as new edge cases emerged, and aligning stakeholders across product, engineering, and business teams required extra facilitation and negotiation. These constraints tested both the design and delivery process, but ultimately strengthened the solution: every compromise and iteration informed a platform that was <b>more resilient, scalable, and grounded in real-world operational needs</b>.</p>
